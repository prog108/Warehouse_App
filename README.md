An application for entering the food into warehouse database.

It is made in tkinter and sqlite3.

1) pip install bs4
2) pip install db-sqlite3
3) pip install tk (if needed, not always)




Hint:
Don't call your working file tkinter.py cause it will confuse the program and the
error will be 'Tk' is not defined
